# Social Networks of Prosobab

This repository contains data that has been mined from the database dump of Prosobab (Waerzeggers et al., 2019; Waerzeggers & Groß, 2022). The database was created by the ERC Consolidator Grant project "Persia and Babylonia" at Leiden University.

A dump of Prosobab's relational SQL database was published in the DANS research data repository (https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-zvn-eece). From the database, we extracted information on all cuneiform documents, persons, and their attestations in documents. From this data, we created several node and edge lists that are ready-made for social network analysis.

## Folders
- Networks: node and edge lists for social networks analysis.
- ProsobabData: the data we extracted from the database, available as an Excel worksheet and TSV files.
- Queries: the SQL queries used for extracting data from the database.
- SupplementaryFiles: various files used in data processing.

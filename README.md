## Mined Prosobab - Mined Database of a Prosopography of Babylonia

This repository contains the network of people and documents mined from the database dumb of The Prosobab - an open access prosopography of Babylonia in the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods (c. 620-330 BCE) https://prosobab.leidenuniv.nl/index.php. The database was created in a ERC Consolidator Grant project at the University of Leiden. The database can be browsed online but it is only possible to extract a certain number of data at a time for your own use. A dumb of the  SQL database was published in DANS https://archaeology.datastations.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.17026/dans-zvn-eece.

We extracted all persons, their attestations in documents, and the documents. We publish here three spreadsheets in a xlxs-file:
- Individual persons with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of the individual in texts
- Documents with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of idividuals in the document
- The attestation of individuals (with ids) in documents (with ids) with information on that occasion.

The tables are also available as separate tsv-files.

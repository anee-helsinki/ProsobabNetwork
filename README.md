# Social Networks of Prosobab

This repository contains data that has been mined from the database dump of Prosobab (Waerzeggers et al., 2019; Waerzeggers & Groß, 2022). The database was created by the ERC Consolidator Grant project "Persia and Babylonia" at Leiden University. The database can be browsed online but, as it is a university project, the continuity of the the site cannot be guaranteed. 

A dump of Prosobab's relational SQL database was published in the DANS research data repository (https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-zvn-eece). From the database, we extracted information on all cuneiform documents, persons, and their attestations in documents. We publish the data as three tsv files in the folder :
- Documents with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of individuals in the document
- Individual persons with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of the individual in texts
- The attestation of individuals (with ids) in documents (with ids) with information on that occasion.

The tables are also available as separate tsv-files in folder ProsobabData.

We also extracted networks with individuals with various relations with each other and with certain roles when attested in the same document.

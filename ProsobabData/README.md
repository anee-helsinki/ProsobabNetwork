#### The data extracted from the Prosobab database dump

mindedProsobab.xlsx contains three spreadsheets:
- **Individual** persons with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of the individual in texts
- **Tablets** (or other documents) with all the information in the database + all the attestations (ids) of individuals in the document
- The **attestation** of individuals (with ids) in documents (with ids) with information on that occasion.

Each table is also available as a separate tsv-file.
